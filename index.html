    </pre><pre><h3> valcano,event in the crust of Earth or another planet or satellite, from which issue eruptions of molten rock, hot rock fragments, and hot gases.
    A volcanic eruption is an awesome display of Earth’s power. Yet, while eruptions are spectacular to watch, they can cause disastrous loss of 
    life and property, especially in densely populated regions of the world. Sometimes beginning with an accumulation of 
    gas-rich magma (molten underground rock) in reservoirs near Earth’s surface, they can be preceded by emissions of steam and gas from small
    vents in the ground. Swarms of small earthquakes, which may be caused by a rising plug of dense, viscous magma oscillating against a 
    sheath of more-permeable magma, may also signal volcanic eruptions, especially explosive ones. In some cases, magma rises in conduits to
    the surface as a thin and fluid lava, either flowing out continuously or shooting straight up in glowing fountains or curtains. In other
    cases, entrapped gases tear the magma into shreds and hurl viscous clots of lava into the air. In more violent eruptions, the magma
    conduit is cored out by an explosive blast, and solid fragments are ejected in a great cloud of ash-laden gas that rises tens of 
    thousands of metres into the air. One feared phenomenon accompanying some explosive eruptions is the nuée ardente, or pyroclastic 
    flow, a fluidized mixture of hot gas and incandescent particles that sweeps down a volcano’s flanks, incinerating everything in its 
    path. Great destruction also can result when ash collects on a high snowfield or glacier, melting large quantities of ice into a flood
    that can rush down a volcano’s slopes as an unstoppable mudflow.</h3>

  <h3>    Volcanoes figure prominently in the mythology of many peoples who have learned to live with eruptions, but science was late in 
    recognizing the important role of volcanism in the evolution of Earth. As late as 1768, the first edition of the Encyclopædia 
    Britannica gave voice to a common misconception by defining volcanoes as “burning mountains, which probably are made up of sulphur and
    some other matter proper to ferment with it, and take fire.” Today geologists agree that volcanism is a profound process resulting 
    from the thermal evolution of planetary bodies. Heat does not easily escape from large bodies such as Earth by the processes of 
    conduction or radiation. Instead, heat is transferred from Earth’s interior largely by convection—that is, the partial melting of
    Earth’s crust and mantle and the buoyant rise of magma to the surface. Volcanoes are the surface sign of this thermal process. Their
    roots reach deep inside Earth, and their fruits are hurled high into the atmosphere.</h3>

    <h1><b><u>Different Stages of Volcanoes</u></b></h1>
<pre><h2>They tend to be conical although there are a variety of forms, depending upon:</h2>
  <h3>  .The nature of the material erupted
  .The type of eruption
  .The amount of change since the eruption</h3>


<h2>Volcanoes are categorised into three main categories:</h2>
<h3> .<u> Active Volcanoes</u>: A volcano will be classified as an active volcano if at the present time it is expected to erupt or is erupting already.
.<u>Dormant Volcanoes</u>: The classification of volcanoes which is called dormant would be a volcano that is not erupting or predicted to erupt
 in the near future.
.<u>Extinct Volcanoes</u>: An extinct volcano is a volcano that no one expects will ever have another eruption.</h3>

<h1><b><u>Reason Behind the Eruption of Volcanoes</u></b></h1>
<pre>
<h3>    The volcano eruption begins with the formation of magma in the lower section of the earth’s crust. The earth’s crust is made up of massive 
    slabs called plates, which fit together like a jigsaw puzzle. The friction during the movement of plates causes earthquakes and volcanic
    eruptions.</h3>

<pre><h3>     With pressure, it travels upwards with tremendous force hitting solid rocks and other materials and creates a new passage to the earth’s
     surface. Once the magma reaches the air it is called lava.</h3></pre>
     <pre><h1><b><u>Types of Volcanoes</u></b></h1>
        <h2>These are grouped into four types:</h2>
        
       <h3>       . Cinder cones
       . Composite volcanoes
       . Shield volcanoes
       . Lava volcanoes</h3>

        <h2>Cinder Cones:</h2> <h3>  These are the simplest type of volcano. They occur when particles and blobs of lava are ejected from a volcanic
             vent. Thelava is blown violently into the air, and the pieces rain down around the vent. Over time, this builds up a circular or oval-shaped cone, with a bowl-shaped crater at the top. Cinder cone volcanoes rarely grow larger than about 1,000 feet above their surroundings.</h3>
        
        <h2>Composite Volcanoes:</h2> <h3>   Composite volcanoes are some of the Earth’s grandest mountains, and they are also called 
            stratovolcanoes. They are typically symmetrical cones of large dimension built of alternating layers of lava flows, steep-sided,
             volcanic ash, blocks, bombs, and cinders and may rise as much as 8,000 feet above their bases.</h3>
        
    <h2>Shield Volcanoes:</h2> <h3>   A shield volcano is a type of volcano usually built almost entirely of fluid lava flows. They have very gentle
         slopes and are developed horizontally. Shield volcanoes are built by effusive eruptions, which flow out in all directions. They almost 
         never have violent eruptions, with basic lava simply flowing out.</h3>
        
<h2>Lava Domes:</h2> <h3>  Lava domes are the fourth type of volcano that we are going to discuss. Unlike composite and shield volcanoes, lava domes
    are of tiny stature. They are formed when the lava is too viscous to flow to a great distance. As the lava dome slowly grows, the outer
    surface cools and hardens as the lava continues to pile within. Eventually, the internal pressure can shatter the outer surface, causing
    loose fragments to spill down its sides. Generally, such lava domes are found on the flanks of larger composite volcanoes.</h3></pre>
